\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We concluded the competition with an overall Kaggle score of \textcolor{red}{SCORE}.
We are satisfied with the achieved results, not just for the experiments results, but also for the contribution on personal knowledge that this project provided us.\\
We are sure there are many improvements we could make, for example a more tailored tiling and preprocessing. Furthermore it may be worth to try different encoding and decoding architectures for the detection model, like VGG and Hourglass, which are also referenced in the CenterNet paper.\\
Another improvement could be the usage of a recurrent model to add context information on each character classification. Like reported on the dataset description of the competition some Kuzushiji characters are very similar, differing just for small details, and their meaning can be more easily inferred from context than by looking at the single character itself.\\
